```

### 1.3 Firebase Setup

- Create a new Firebase project in the Firebase Console
- Enable Email/Password authentication
- Set up Firebase configuration in the app

## Phase 2: Authentication Implementation

### 2.1 Firebase Authentication Service

- Create a service to handle Firebase authentication operations:
  - User registration
  - User login
  - Password reset
  - Logout
  - Get current user

### 2.2 Authentication UI Components

- Create Login form component
- Create Registration form component
- Create protected route component to restrict access to authenticated users
- Implement form validation

### 2.3 Authentication State Management

- Create auth slice with Redux Toolkit
- Implement actions for:
  - Set user
  - Clear user
  - Handle authentication errors
  - Track loading state
- Configure Redux Persist to store authentication state

## Phase 3: Movie API Integration

### 3.1 API Service

- Register for The Movie Database (TMDB) API key
- Create a service to handle API requests:
  - Fetch popular movies
  - Fetch movies by genre
  - Fetch movie details
  - Search for movies
  - Get movie images and posters

### 3.2 Movie State Management

- Create movies slice with Redux Toolkit
- Implement actions for:
  - Fetch and store popular movies
  - Fetch and store movies by genre
  - Fetch and store movie details
  - Store search results
  - Handle API errors and loading states

### 3.3 Watch Later Functionality

- Create watch later slice with Redux Toolkit
- Implement actions for:
  - Add movie to watch later
  - Remove movie from watch later
  - Configure Redux Persist to store watch later list

## Phase 4: UI Implementation

### 4.1 Layout Components

- Create header component with navigation
- Create footer component
- Implement responsive layout design

### 4.2 Home Page

- Create hero section with featured movie
- Implement horizontal slider for popular movies
- Create genre sections with movie cards
- Add loading states and error handling

### 4.3 Movie Details Page

- Create movie details component
- Display movie information (title, overview, release date, rating, etc.)
- Add "Add to Watch Later" functionality
- Show related movies or recommendations
- Implement responsive design for desktop and mobile

### 4.4 Search Page

- Create search form
- Implement search results display
- Add loading state and no results handling
- Add pagination for search results

### 4.5 Watch Later Page

- Display list of saved movies
- Add option to remove movies from the list
- Show empty state when no movies are saved

### 4.6 Common Components

- Create movie card component
- Implement loading skeleton components
- Create error message components
- Build UI components for ratings, genres, etc.

## Phase 5: State Management & Data Flow

### 5.1 Redux Store Configuration

- Set up Redux store with necessary middleware
- Configure Redux Persist to store specific slices
- Implement connection between Redux and Firebase

### 5.2 Async Actions

- Implement thunks for asynchronous operations:
  - Authentication operations
  - API requests
  - Error handling

### 5.3 Custom Hooks

- Create custom hooks for common operations:
  - `useAuth` for authentication state and operations
  - `useMovies` for movie-related operations
  - `useWatchLater` for watch later functionality

## Phase 6: Routing & Navigation

### 6.1 Route Configuration

- Set up router with the following routes:
  - `/` - Home page
  - `/login` - Login page
  - `/register` - Registration page
  - `/movie/:id` - Movie details page
  - `/search` - Search page
  - `/watch-later` - Watch Later page

### 6.2 Protected Routes

- Add routing between pages

### Week 4: Watch Later and Final Touches

- Implement watch later functionality
- Add responsive design adjustments
- Test and fix bugs
- Deploy application

## Key Technical Considerations

1. **Authentication Flow**: Use Firebase Authentication for secure user management without a backend.

2. **State Management**: Organize Redux slices by feature (auth, movies, watchLater) for clean code separation.

3. **API Requests**: Create a dedicated service for movie API calls to keep components clean.

4. **Persistence**: Use Redux Persist selectively for critical data like authentication and watch later list.

5. **Performance**: Lazy load components and routes to keep initial bundle size small.

6. **Responsive Design**: Ensure the app works well on mobile, tablet, and desktop.

7. **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling for both authentication and API requests.
